# LONI API — Implementation Status (as of 2026-01-14)

This checklist is generated by comparing the API spec in `API-DOCUMENTATION.md` with what currently exists in the codebase.

## Legend

- **✅ Implemented (Client wired)**: there is a service/repository calling the endpoint, and the UI layer uses it to load real data.
- **🟨 Stubbed / UI-only**: screen exists but uses mock data or a placeholder service.
- **❌ Missing**: no client code found calling the endpoint.
- **— N/A**: not applicable for that app.

Apps:
- **Consumer app**: `loni_backup/` (package: `loni_africa`)
- **Admin app**: `admin/`
- **Publisher app**: `publisher/`

Additional legend:
